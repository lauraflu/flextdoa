# Code accompanying the dataset for the paper "FlexTDOA: Robust and Scalable Time-Difference of Arrival Localization Using Ultra-Wideband Devices"

This repository contains code examples for generating the plots in the paper:

```PÄƒtru, G. C., Flueratoru, L., Vasilescu, I., Niculescu, D., & Rosner, D. (2023). FlexTDOA: Robust and Scalable Time-Difference of Arrival Localization Using Ultra-Wideband Devices. IEEE Access```

The dataset can be found at: https://zenodo.org/record/7619764

Download the dataset at place it in a directory called `data` under this repository. Make sure that the subdirectories `fixed_vs_changing`, `nlos`, etc. are placed under the directory `data` and not under another subdirectory.

After this, you can run the examples in the Python Notebook.
